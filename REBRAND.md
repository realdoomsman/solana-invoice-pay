# 🎯 NOVIQ Rebrand: What Phantom Can't Do

## New Positioning:

### **"NOVIQ: Safe Trading & Payments on Solana"**

**Tagline:** "Escrow, Splits, and Crowdfunding for Solana"

---

## 🎯 The 3 Core Features:

### 1. 🤝 **ESCROW** (The Main One)
**"Trade safely with anyone"**

**What it does:**
- Both parties deposit funds
- Funds locked until both confirm
- Safe P2P trading
- No trust needed

**Use cases:**
- OTC trades (buying/selling SOL, tokens)
- NFT sales
- Freelance work (pay on delivery)
- Any P2P deal

**Why you can't do this with Phantom:**
Phantom = direct send. No protection. Get scammed.
NOVIQ = Escrow. Both protected. Safe.

---

### 2. 💰 **SPLITS**
**"Share payments automatically"**

**What it does:**
- One payment → Multiple wallets
- Auto-distribute percentages
- Instant settlement

**Use cases:**
- Split profits with team
- Pay multiple freelancers
- Revenue sharing
- Group expenses

**Why you can't do this with Phantom:**
Phantom = Send to one wallet. Manual splits.
NOVIQ = Auto-split to many. One transaction.

---

### 3. 🎯 **CROWDFUNDING**
**"Pool funds together"**

**What it does:**
- Set funding goal
- Track progress
- Auto-refund if goal not met
- Transparent on-chain

**Use cases:**
- Group buys (presales)
- Community projects
- Fundraising
- Shared investments

**Why you can't do this with Phantom:**
Phantom = Individual sends. No tracking.
NOVIQ = Organized crowdfund. Progress bar. Goals.
