# Extension Icons Needed

You need to create 3 icon files:

1. `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
2. `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
3. `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Way to Create Icons

### Option 1: Online Tool
1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload your NOVIQ logo
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename and place them here

### Option 2: Use Figma/Canva
1. Create a 128x128 canvas
2. Add your logo
3. Export as PNG at 128x128, 48x48, and 16x16

### Option 3: Simple Placeholder
For testing, you can use any PNG images temporarily:
- Just name them icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
- Place them in this folder
- Replace with proper icons later

## Icon Design Tips

- Use your NOVIQ logo
- Make it recognizable at small sizes
- Use high contrast colors
- Keep it simple
- Test at 16x16 to ensure it's readable

Once you have the icons, the extension will be ready to use!
